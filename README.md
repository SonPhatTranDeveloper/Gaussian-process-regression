# Gaussian Process Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with Gaussian Process Regression implementation, using Cholesky factorization.

The detailed explanation for the code can be found at [my blog post](https://paperthatiread.com/index.php/2023/12/25/introduction-to-gaussian-processes/).

## How to run the code

1) Install the prerequisite modules from the 'requirements.txt' file.
2) Run the Jupyter Notebook file.
